              "'Essay on The Cow \\nby Radhakanta Swain | category Essay  \\nIntroduction  \\nCows are found in almost all parts of the world. Th ey are very useful \\ndomestic animals. Every child is fed with the cow’s  milk. Hence, the \\ncow is a well-known quadruped beast. \\nDescription  \\nCows are found in many colours, such as white, blac k and red. Some \\nare of mixed colours. Cows are neither small nor ve ry big. The body \\nof the cow is bulky. There are two horns on her hea d. The horns are \\ncurved or straight and pointed. The cow has a long face. She has two \\neyes. Her eyes are black and expressive. She has no  tooth on her \\nupper jaw. On her lower jaw there are eight teeth. She has a long \\ntail. Her tail is thin an narrow. There is a tuft o f hair at the end of \\nher tail. The cow has four hoofs at the end of her four legs. Each \\nhoof is split into tow parts. She ha an udder  betw een her hind legs. \\nHer body is covered with furs. Her stomach is divid ed into four \\nparts. So, she has to gaze the fodder and the chew the cud. Green \\ngrass is the most natural food for the cow. Besides , she eats straw, \\ngrams, leaves and grains. She drinks water, rice-wa ter and gruel. \\nUsefulness  \\nThe cow is so useful that the Hindus in India call her cow, the \\nmother. They worship her as a goddess. Her milk is very nutritious. \\nIt is a food for the children and diet for the sick . her milk is made \\ninto curd, cheese, butter and ghee. The cream of he r milk is nice. \\nMany kinds of sweets are made from her milk-product s. her dung is \\na rich manure for the crops. Her urine is made into  medicine. When \\na cow dies her horns are made into combs, holders a nd play-things. \\nHer hoofs are made into glue. Her skin is tanned an d made into \\nshoes and many other things. Her bones made into ma nure which is \\ncalled bone-meal. \\nConclusion  \\nWe should take care of the cow. We should keep her shed neat and \\nclean. We should feed her properly. We should be gr ateful to her. We should never sell thee cow for slaughter. Becaus e she is the \\nsavior of our life. \\n '"
